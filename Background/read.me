The com.heinsberg.LearningManagerProjekt.Background package is a collection of classes that provide functionality for managing a student's study progress.
The main class in this package is the Study class.

The Study class represents an entire study program and contains information on all semesters, subjects, and learning phases.
It provides methods for managing the learning process,
 such as starting and ending learning phases, and adding new subjects and semesters.

The Semester class represents a single semester of a study program,
and contains information on the semester's start and end date, as well as its number in the study program.
It also contains information on the subjects and learning phases that are associated with this semester.

The Subject class represents a single subject that is part of a study program.
It contains information on the subject's name, semester, and ECTS points.
 It also contains information on all learning phases that are associated with this subject.

All of these classes work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing a student's study progress.
The Study class serves as the main entry point into the system,
and provides methods for starting and ending learning phases,
and adding new subjects and semesters.
The Semester, Subject, Week, and LearningPhase classes provide more detailed information on specific aspects of the study progress,
such as the subjects studied during a semester, the learning phases associated with a subject,
and the time spent on a specific learning phase.
